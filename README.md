# Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 100m can hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet - you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending a BDD/SpecFlow course.

## You will need

* *Visual Studio 2019* or Visual Studio 2017 (Community, Professional or Enterprise edition)
* *.NET Core v3.1* (runtime and SDK, installed by default with Visual Studio 2019)
* *Deveroom for SpecFlow Visual Studio* extension (installed from Visual Studio Extensions and Updates, see instructions at https://github.com/specsolutions/deveroom-visualstudio/wiki/Installation). If you have the SpecFlow for Visual Studio 2019 extension installed, we recommend disabling it (for the time of the course at least) and install the Deveroom extension that works more predictable with the exercise code base. 

## Get the code

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.net.git
    
Or simply [download](https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.net/releases) a zip and expand it into a directory on your computer.

## Open the solution

* Open the `Shouty.NET.sln` file in Visual Studio
* Select Test > Run > All Tests from the menu, or press `CTRL-R, A`

if you see two tests passing and two tests failing, you're good to go.
