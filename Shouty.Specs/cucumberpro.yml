  # Results are published to Cucumber Pro using HTTP/HTTPS. Each Cucumber Pro project has a token for this purpose.
  # You can find it in the project settings (press `?` to display it).
  # This token should be assigned to a `CUCUMBERPRO_TOKEN` environment variable on the build server, on a per-project basis.
  # Consult your CI server's documentation for details about defining per-project environment variables.
  # Some CI servers such as Travis and Circle CI allow you to define environment variables in a file checked into git.
  # *DO NOT DO THIS* - as it would allow anyone with read acceess to your repository to publish results.

  # We recommend setting this with a CUCUMBERPRO_URL environment variable defined globally on your build server.
