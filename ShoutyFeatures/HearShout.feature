	Given Sally is in the Norwich Castle
	And Phil is in the Bell Hotel Norwich

	Then Phil should hear "You around Phil?"

  Scenario: Phil hears Jeff's shout after Sally's shout
	Given Phil is around
	When Sally shouts "one"
	And Jeff shouts "two"
	Then Phil should hear:
	  | message |
	  | one     |
	  | two     |
